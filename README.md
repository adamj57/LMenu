# LMenu

## Requirements 
This library requires [LChar](http://github.com/adamj57/LChar) to work.
Also, it's designed to work with Novation Launchpad - a piece of music tech that is usually used to perform in front of a audience or a camera.

## What it does?
It turns Launchpad into HID device - you can run your own apps on it, control desktop apps etc. - whatever your imagination whispers to you.
This project is still **in progress**, but frozen. You can support it by giving a pull request.
